Project Overview: E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis

Introduction:
This project is a comprehensive case study focusing on the analysis of e-commerce customer behavior. The primary objective is to explore and predict customer churn using a dataset of customer transaction behavior in an e-commerce scenario. The project combines data mining and machine learning techniques to gain insights into customer behavior and provide information for potential business strategies.

Objectives:
1. Data Integration and Preparation: Effectively merge and preprocess two different datasetsâ€”one containing detailed customer personal information and the other containing customer purchase information. This involves data cleaning and initial exploration.
2. Decision Tree Analysis: Utilize SAS Enterprise Miner (SAS EM) to create a decision tree model for analyzing customer behavior patterns.
3. Application of Ensemble Methods: Implement ensemble methods, especially Bagging and Boosting, using the random forest algorithm and other advanced techniques to enhance model performance.
4. Final Comparison of Different Model Performances.

Tools and Technologies:
- Talend Data Integration: Used for effectively merging two different datasets, ensuring a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
- Talend Data Prep: Crucial for initial data exploration and transformation, playing a vital role in preparing the dataset for further analysis in SAS EM.
- SAS Enterprise Miner (SAS EM): A key component for creating decision tree models, handling missing values, specifying variable roles, and implementing ensemble methods.

Methodology:
The project follows a structured approach:
1. Data Integration: Use Talend Data Integration to connect and merge the datasets containing customer personal information and purchase information.
2. Data Preparation: Employ Talend Data Prep to conduct preliminary exploration and processing of the merged dataset, including data cleaning and standardization.
3. Analysis using SAS EM:
   - Import the prepared dataset into SAS EM.
   - Specify variable roles and handle missing values.
   - Create and evaluate decision tree models.
   - Apply ensemble methods such as Bagging and Boosting.
   - Select the most suitable model.
4. Obtain weights for different factors affecting churn rates, discuss conclusions supporting business decisions.

Challenges and Solutions:
Throughout the project, various challenges were encountered, such as dealing with missing values, integrating different datasets, and addressing the imbalance in the target variable of the decision tree model. These challenges were addressed through strategic data processing, thoughtful model selection, and the use of different configurations in SAS EM modeling.

Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrates the use of SAS EM, Talend Data Integration, and Talend Data Prep in analyzing e-commerce customer behavior. The comparison between decision tree and ensemble models identifies the most suitable model, revealing the factors that most influence customer churn and providing valuable insights for business strategy formulation.
